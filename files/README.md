Adaptions:
* changed internal height to support also slightly bigger EPROM packages
* changed label area to support standard laser/ink-jet labels (88.9x46.6mm, e.g. Herma 10776, Top-Stick 8725)
* cut-out for DIP switches (case-top_dip variations)
* cut-out for easy access to EPROM (case-top_dip_open variation)
